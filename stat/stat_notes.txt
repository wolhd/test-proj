Fisher Information I(theta)

I(theta) = - E[2nd deriv loglik-pdf wrt to theta]

- equal to negative the Expectation of the 2nd derivative of the log likelihood 
 of a single instance (a log of pdf, not log likelihood of a set of samples).
 The derivative is w.r.t the parameter of interest theta.
 Then Expectation is calculated by taking the average of this expression
 (the 2nd dervative) weighted by the pdf of x (X being the random variable
 this pdf represents)
 The Fisher Information gives how sensitive the likelihood (pdf) is
 to the parameter of interest (theta).


MLE Maximum Likelihood Estimator
- given some regularity conditions (which are?)
- is **asymptotically**
  - Consistent:
       (same as true parameter)
  - Unbiased:  
       (Expectation of the MLE estimator is same as true parameter)
  - Normal rand. variable: 
       (MLE estim - true param) / sqrt(Variance(MLE estim)) -> N(0,1)
       or
       sqrt(n)(MLE estim - true param) -> N(0, I(true param)^(-1))
         i.e., asymptotic variance is 1/(fisher info)
